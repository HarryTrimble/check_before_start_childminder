## Design pattern: check before you start

Help users understand whether they should use your service before they start, so that they don’t waste time and effort

If you do this well, you’ll improve user satisfaction and reduce unnecessary calls and applications to your service team.

## 1. Save time and money

You may have problems with your service, eg failure demand, including the following:

You may get calls from users asking:

- [how to do a thing, eg apply, register]
- [what they need to do, eg fill in a form, visit a post office, pay money]
- [when they need to do specific things, eg phoning before filling in a form]
- [what rules apply to their situation, eg if they're applying for a visa from outside the EEA and EU]
- [which forms they might need]
- [what information do they put in a form]

You might be processing applications from users who:

- [don't need to apply]
- [aren't ready to apply]
- [aren't eligible]
